## FAQ

**Q: Should I use it?**

**A:** Probably not. This SSG is _exactly_ what I need, which means it is probably not what you need.

**Q: But _can_ I use it?**

**A:** Sure. Just be aware that I currently make no guarantees about its reliability or its API stability.

**Q: Will you eventually document it?**

**A:** Possibly.
